# Datamine-Job-Descriptions

This program was designed to farm job descriptions from GovernmentJobs.com.

Given the root URL, it will pull up each job class and make a pdf of the job description.

After completing the page it will click next and continue on.

PDFs are saved in an output folder that must exist prior to running the script.
